# Flykit Agency Deployment Instructions

## Building the project for deployment
1. Run the build script to generate production files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. This will create a `dist` directory with optimized files.

## Deploying the website with the standalone deployment script
1. After building, you can use our simple deployment script:
   ```
   node deploy.js
   ```

2. This will start a server on port 3000 (by default) or use the PORT environment variable.

## Deploying to a hosting service
For deployment to professional hosting services:

1. Upload the following files to your host:
   - dist/ (the entire directory)
   - index.html (from root)
   - deploy.js (optional - for Node.js hosting)

2. For static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages):
   - Point your hosting service to the root directory
   - Set the build command to `npm run build`
   - Set the publish directory to `dist/`

3. For Windows users:
   - Use the updated package.json with cross-env
   - Or manually set NODE_ENV=production before running
