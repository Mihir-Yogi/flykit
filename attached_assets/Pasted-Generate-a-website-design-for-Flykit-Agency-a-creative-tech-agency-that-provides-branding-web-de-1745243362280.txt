2. About Section:
Use large, high-quality images or illustrations of the agency’s team or office environment.

Include a short description of Flykit, focusing on the creative and tech-driven nature of the agency.

Scroll-based animations: As users scroll down, elements should fade in, slide in from the sides, or scale up.

Hover effects: Buttons, icons, and images should have subtle hover animations (color shifts, shadows, or slight movements).

Button animations: Add smooth transitions and animations to buttons when hovered, clicked, or focused.

Parallax effects: Add a sense of depth to the page with background images moving at different speeds than the rest of the page content.
